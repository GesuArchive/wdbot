# White Dream Bot
You need discord bot. If you don't have any just kill yourself.

## How to use this
0. Byond installed? Install it.
2. Copy `h.js` file into some dir, it doesn't cares what dir.
1. Install all dependencies by issuing this `npm i discord.js shelljs chokidar log-timestamp`.
3. Edit `h.js` as your server(s) need. The main things you need to edit is on top of the file.
9. Create dirs for `production` and `repos`. In the `repos` dir clone your server and name his folder like `repo_SERVERNAME`.
6. Replace your `deploy.sh` in the server repo with ours.
7. Now run `node h.js` and that is.
4. You fool, you forgot to install screen. Do it by `sudo apt install screen`.
666. Also use this, if your bot crashes sometimes: https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever

## And yes, you need to compile all libs and place in the server prod dir
Do it, lazy man.
